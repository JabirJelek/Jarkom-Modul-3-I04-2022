## 1. Loid with Franky plan to create the map above with criteria WISE as DNS Server, Westalis as DHCP Server, Berlint as Proxy Server 
 we can enter this code into WISE, to make it as DNS Server
```bash
apt-get update
apt-get install bind9 -y
service bind9 restart
```

And enter this syntax in Berlint to make it as Proxy Server
```
apt-get update
apt-get install squid -y
service squid start
```

Last, we enter this syntax into Westalis to make it as DHCP Server
```
apt-get update
apt-get install isc-dhcp-server -y
service isc-dhcp-server start
```


## 2. and Ostania as DHCP Relay

Enter This syntax in Ostania to make it as DCHP Relay
```bash
apt-get update
apt-get install isc-dhcp-relay -y
service isc-dhcp-relay start
```


## 3.Client that go through Switch1 have the IP range from [prefix IP].1.50 - [prefix IP].1.88 and [prefix IP].1.120 - [prefix IP].1.155 

Client that go through Switch1 have the IP range from 10.38.1.50 - 10.38.1.88 and 10.38.1.120 - 10.38.1.155

```bash
subnet 10.39.1.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
    range 10.39.1.50 10.39.1.88;
    range 10.39.1.120 10.39.1.155;
    ...
}
```

## 4. Client that go through Switch3 have the IP range from [prefix IP].3.10 - [prefix IP].3.30 dan [prefix IP].3.60 - [prefix IP].3.85

Client that go through Switch3 have the IP range from 10.38.1.50 - 10.38.1.88 and 10.38.1.120 - 10.38.1.155
```bash
subnet 10.39.3.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
    range 10.38.3.10 10.38.3.30;
    range 10.38.3.60 10.38.3.85;
    ...
}
```

## 5. Client gets the DNS from WISE and client can connect to the internet through the DNS.


```bash 
subnet 10.38.1.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
    ...
    option domain-name-servers 10.38.2.2;
    ...
}
subnet 10.38.3.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
    ...
    option domain-name-servers 10.38.2.2;
    ...
}
```

## 6. The length of time the DHCP server lends an IP address to client via Switch1 is 5 minutes, while the client via Switch3 is 10 minutes. With a maximum time allocated for borrowing an IP address is 115 minutes.

```bash
subnet 10.38.1.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
    â€¦
    default-lease-time 300;
    max-lease-time 6900;
}
subnet 10.38.3.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
    ...
    default-lease-time 600;
    max-lease-time 6900;
}
```

## 7. Loid and Franky plan to make Eden as a server for exchanging information with a fixed IP address with IP [prefix IP].3.13

Eden as a server for exchanging information with a fixed IP address with IP 10.38.3.13

```bash
host Eden {
    hardware ethernet 32:0d:7a:0d:8c:93;
    fixed-address 10.38.3.13;
}
auto eth0
iface eth0 inet dhcp
hwaddress ether 32:0d:7a:0d:8c:93
```
